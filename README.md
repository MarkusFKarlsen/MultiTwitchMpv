MPV Streamers Project

Basic rust project for running multiple Twitch stream via the MPV player.
Written using Rust and the egui framework. 

This program requires MPV to be available as a command in the terminal of your system.
If it is not, you need to download (version 0.33 or higher) and add it to your path in your system environment variables.
Current version of the program only works for Windows.
